### About

Cobwebs are annoying, fishing is boring, and spiders are creepy. So what do you do when you need string? How about just make some?

Cordage allows you to craft string using natural fibrous resources. It adds three shapeless crafting recipes using tallgrass, saplings, or vines, as seen below. This could be useful in skyblock-style maps without Ex Nihilo, or simply as a peaceful alternative to killing spiders in any kind of map.

Cordage also registers `minecraft:tallgrass` (Item ID 31) to the Ore Dictionary under the name "tallgrass" for use in one of the recipes.

This should be compatible with virtually any other mod or combination of mods (any mod items oreDictionaried as `tallgrass`, `treeSapling`, or `vine` will work).

As of [version 1.1](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cordage/files/2338568 "cordage-1.10.2-1.1.jar"), you can also turn rotten flesh into Sinew (with a similar shapeless recipe), which can then be crafted into string.
